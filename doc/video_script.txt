D Z C B - initials for DMR Zone Channel Builder

is a codeplug generator written in Python targeting DMR radios such
as the TYT MD-UV380, Anytone 878, and Radioddity OpenGD77, among others.

dzcb fetches frequency information from a variety of sources,
most notably PNWDigital's auto-generated repeater/talkgroup
matrix and Repeaterbook proximity search for known repeaters
within some distance to a point of interest.

the analog and digital channels from multiple sources are combined
and filtered according to built-in and user-specified rules.

finally, dzcb converts the generated codeplug to a variety of output
formats to be further modified by hand, if desired, and written to the
radio.

the separate, but related repo, "example-codeplug", leverages
dzcb and github actions to automatically generate codeplugs
in the cloud whenever the codeplug source files are modified.

next i'll demonstrate how to download a cloud-generated codeplug
and open it in each supported CPS.
